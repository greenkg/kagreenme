One the last full day of our four-day trip to Iceland, we did a horse riding tour, and enjoyed Laugarvatn spa.

In the morning before we flew home, we briefly visited Reykjavik.

For those of you who are here for the photos, I apologize that there is not too much to see from these last two days. The activities on Day 4 did not lend themselves to photography.

<h3>Horse Riding</h3>
<p>Morning, Day 4</p>

The guide kindly took a few photos of us, so you can see us above modeling the latest in full-body rain wear for tourists in Iceland. (The tour group wouldn't let us take photos of each other since they wanted us to have two hands on the reins at all times.)

We were happy to have the rain suits because it was very cold and a little rainy, as usual!

This part about the horses is important though. This is the turning point in my life where I changed from a sensible person who did not ride horses regularly, to a person taking two to three riding lessons a week.

Now, my mother and my sister are horse people. They have been my whole life. We even had horses at home growing up, so I had every opportunity to ride. Every now and then I would give it a try and remember, "oh nope, this is not my sport."

But somewhere in the back of my brain was a thought that one day, maybe I'd get a horse to trail ride on. And I had already learned about how great Icelandic horses were, so there was already a thought growing in my brain that maybe my trail horse would be an Icelandic horse.

Now, you might think that I had an amazing experience on this ride, and I finally got turned on to riding. Nope! Actually, my stirrups were too long, and I had the wrong kind of shoes, so they kept getting stuck in the stirrup irons. I knew just enough about riding to feel nervous about this. In an effort to unstick my shoes, I kept losing the stirrups entirely. Then my saddle began to slide sideways off the horse. When I tried to slow down to get everything in order, the guide would shout at me to keep up with the group. And then she told me I should be smiling more. (Thanks.)

But! The horse was great. And as I was working to stay upright and on the horse, I still managed to have a good time. And I finished the day realizing that if I ever wanted to have a trail horse one day, I should probably start taking some riding lessons to prepare.

So once I got home, I started taking weekly riding lessons. And as soon as I started doing that, my traveling companion (who is a horse rider) suggested that we do a multi-day riding tour in Iceland. That tour happened in August of 2018, and you can read all about it here!

<h3>Laugarvatn</h3>
<p>Afternoon, Day 4</p>

----

If you look up "things to do in Iceland", you'll find "Blue Lagoon" near the top of the list of attractions. However, this geothermal lake was closed for repairs during this visit to Iceland.

Instead, we visited Laugarvatn Fontana spa, which is smaller, but very nice, geothermal spa situated next to a (cold) lake. The spa has three outdoor mineral baths with varying temperatures, all made from beautiful stonework. They also have steam rooms, and a Finnish-style sauna.

You can see a view of the lake from the hot pools, and you can even bathe in the lake if you choose. We did walk over to it and feel the temperature, but no thanks!

The spa was a very welcome activity after three busy days of touring, and a morning of bouncing on horses.

<h3>Reykjavik</h3>
<p>Morning, Day 5</p>

----

Our last morning in Iceland dawned cold and rainy. (Surprise!) We decided to spend a little time in Reykjavik, because how can you visit Iceland and skip its one major city?

We found a nice little cafe called Bersson Mathus for breakfast.

We visited the Hallgrímskirkja, which just means "Church of Hallgrímur" but seems pretty grim looking at this photo.

In fact, all of my images from Reykjavik on this day look pretty grim, thanks to the cold and cloudy sky. I didn't take too many pictures! Luckily, I visited Reykjavik again in July 2018, and had several moments of sunshine! (Interspersed with cold and rain of course!) So you can check out my post from my second trip if you're interested in seeing a nicer view of the city.
