We explored Iceland's southern coast in a four-day excursion at the tail end of April. We spent two days driving east as far as Jokulsarlon Lagoon, then headed back west to tour the classic Golden Circle sites.

<h3>Keflavik to Vik</h3>
<p>Morning of Day 1</p>

----

After landing at Keflavik airport around 6:30am local time, we headed south and east along a coastal road.

The first hour of driving, the landscape was flat, rocky, and very alien-looking. The volcanic rocks that cover the ground appeared to have been ejected out of a volcano recently, although it has been many years since an eruption has affected this area.

Our first stop was Selvogsviti Lighthouse, a bright orange structure accessed via a muddy dirt track. We parked the car when the road got too pitted with holes, and walked the rest of the way.

The next part of our drive was a strange sort of landscape. The road is on very flat land, covered in volcanic rock and moss that has grown over the rocks.

Although the photos show that spring is slowly arriving, the weather is still cold and wintry. We are some of the very few tourists at most of the attractions we visit. We had a hard time finding a restaurant that was open to eat lunch at. The route does not have much along it, and the places we had planned to stop were all still closed for the winter.

After lunch, we saw our first herd of Icelandic horses. Horses are important here. Until fairly recently in the island's history, horses were the best way to get around the rocky landscape. There are about 80,000 horses in Iceland, and they are all the Icelandic Horse breed. More on horses later.

When driving east along the coast, to the right is the ocean and to the left side are the mountains. The road is on a flat plain between the two. Because the road is at the edge of the mountains, there are dozens of waterfalls to be seen, as melt water pours down from the mountains.

The pictures below show the waterfall Seljalandsfoss, as seen from the road, and then closer up, after we had parked the card to visit it, with people for scale.

If you look up photographs of Seljalandsfoss on Google Image Search, you will see images of it cascading down in an organized stream, and even some photos taken from the small cavern behind the waterfall. However, on the day we visited, in late April, the wind was blowing in massive gusts. my image appears misty, because the air is full of water blown from the waterfall.

In the left side of the second photo, you'll notice what looks like a little line on the hill next to the falls. This is a set of stairs that allows visitors to get closer to the falls. Thanks to the wind-blown water, these stairs were completely coated in ice. We did climb the stairs, but I don't have any photos from there, since I didn't want to let go of the handrail, or get the camera soaked in the water blowing through the air.

We hopped back into the car to warm up and continue on to Vik, where we would spend the night.

<h3>Around Vik</h3>
<p>Afternoon of Day 1</p>

----

In Vik, we had the comforting thought that we would be sleeping just a few miles from the Katla volcano. Based on the amount of gases the volano is expelling, geologists are pretty sure that Katla will erupt in the near future. Katla last erupted in 1918, and prior to that, it had a record of erupting every 40 to 80 years. So we are a few decades past due! Luckily, no eruptions occurred while we were visiting.

Now, I am fairly sure the picture below is of Katla, but in my jet lagged state, by the afternoon, I was a bit confused about what we were visiting. It certainly didn't seem like a volcano about to erupt, although it does have the look of a mountain that had lava run down its sides a hundred years ago.

Vik is well known for Kirkjufjara beach, a black sand beach from which an intrepid tourist can see the Dyrhólaey arch to one side, and the Reynisdrangar stacks close by. (Both of those are dramatic rock formations out in the ocean).

However, Kirkjufjara beach has been the site of some tragedies. It was temporarily closed in January 2017, after a German woman was drowned by a "sneaker wave". It was re-opened by the time of our visit (April 2017), but with an extremely detailed information board added, with pictures of where a tourist was standing right before being drowned by a wave. The waves appeared very small and gentle when we visited, and it is easy to see how easy it would be to think it is safe to walk close to the water. However, the beach commonly has unexpected large waves that can easily wash a human out to sea.

The beach is a located in a small stretch of land with rock formations at its back. As you walk along the beach, the strip of land between the cliffs and the ocean becomes smaller and smaller. It is tempting to walk along the beach to climb on the rocks at the end, but this pushes you closer and closer to the water. (You can read an article <a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/connect-with-locals/regina/extremely-dangerous-waves-by-reynisfjara-and-kirkjufjara-in-south-iceland">here</a> written by an icelander who is very concerned about making sure the dangers are known.) Being warning-abiding, sensible visitors, we stayed a good distance away from the water.

In the shot below, you can see the cliff face that is at our back when the facing the view in the photo above. The stacked basalt cliffs are a curiosity of their own for tourists. During mating season, puffins nest in these cliffs.

I didn't get a shot of the Dyrhólaey arch formation, as the setting sun was right next to it at the time of our visit.

The below photo is another angle of the Reynisdrangar formation. They are formed from stacked basalt, similar to the cliffs on the beach itself. The legend is that Reynisdranger were formed when two trolls failed to land their ship on shore before daylight. When daylight broke, they became needles of rock, stuck in the ocean.

Notes:
We stayed at Hotel Katla in Vik.
