One the third day of our four-day trip to Iceland, we drove back west towards the Golden Circle. Along the way we stopped at Skogafoss waterfall. We visited Geysir, Gullfoss and Þingvellir all in one afternoon.

<h3>Drive Back West</h3>
<p>Morning, Day 3</p>

----

The next day, we drove back west, aiming for the Golden Circle. The Golden Circle consists of three beautiful spots in southwest Iceland: Þingvellir National Park, the Geysir Geothermal Area, and Gullfoss waterfall. The three attractions are all quite close together, and quite close to Reykjavik, making these attractions the most popular destinations for visitors to Iceland.

But first, we enjoyed more views of the Icelandic landscape from our car as we drove back west. According to google maps, the drive is about 4.5 hours. We made it last a day, with stops along the way.

Sometimes, we passed towns that were marked on the map that, from the road, appeared to consist of just 3 or 4 homes.

Imagine living with these backdrops as your backyard.

We met some friendly horses.

And passed some farms.

<h3>Skógafoss</h3>
<p>Day 3, Afternoon</p>

----

We made a stop to stretch our legs at Skógafoss (located about 30 min west of Vik, the town we stayed in our first night). Skógafoss is one of the largest waterfalls in Iceland with a drop of 60 meters, and a width of 15 meters.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Skogafoss" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/iceland2017-skogafoss.png" class="img-fluid">

There is a trail / stairs up the hill on the right side of the falls.

The spray from the waterfall produces a rainbow, which we could see as we started up the path to the top.

We climbed to the viewing platform at the top.

Once at the top of the falls, there are hiking trails. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to explore further along the trails during our visit.

Side note: There is a restaurant called Fossbúð close to the falls that had the most reasonably priced meals we encountered during this trip.

<h3>Geysir</h3>
<p>Day 3, Golden Circle, First Stop</p>

----

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Geysir Park" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/iceland2017-geysir-landscape.png" class="img-fluid">

The final stop along the Golden Cirlce is Geysir. The name Geysir comes from the Icelandic word "geysa", "to gush." This was the first geyser known to modern Europeans, hence the English word "geyser" was derived from this site.

Geysir is technically still active, but eruptions are infrequent, and have stopped altogether for years at a time. Earthquake activity can disrupt and change the pattern of eruptions. In 2000, an earthquake revived Geysir, which reached 122m in height for 2 days, about 8 times a day. By 2003, activity decreased to eruptions about 3 times a day.

At the time we visited, in 2017, the geyser seemed dormant.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Geysir" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/iceland2017-geysir.png" class="img-fluid">

So we couldn't see Geysir errupt, but not to worry, a mere 50m away is Stokkur Geysir, which still erupts with regularity every few minutes to a height of 15 to 20m (sometimes as high as 40m though!)

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Strokkur" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/iceland2017-strokkur-wait.png" class="img-fluid">

"Strokkur" is Icelandic for "churn." This geyser was first "unlocked" in 1789 following an earthquake. Another earthquake blocked it again around 1900. In 1963, locals cleaned out the blocked conduit, resulting in regular eruptions ever since, much to the enjoyment of tourists.

<h3>Gullfoss</h3>
<p>Day 3, Golden Circle, Second Stop</p>

----

Our next stop along the Golden Circle was Gullfoss, described to me as "the Niagara Falls of Iceland." The wide Olfusa river cascades down a series of three drops.

Like most massive natural features, a photo cannot really give a sense of the scale of this waterfall. The final crevice that Gullfoss drops into is 32m deep, compared to the drop of 50m at Niagara Falls.

<h3>Þingvellir</h3>
<p>Day 3, Golden Circle, Third Stop</p>

----

Thingvellir is a flat area lying in a rift valley between the the North American tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Thingvellir" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/iceland2017-thingvellir.png" class="img-fluid">

The Althing, the national parliament of Iceland, was held here starting in 930 AD until 1798. From the founding of the Althing until 1271, this location was also used for legislative and judicial processes. "Law Rock" formed a platform for speeches, where the law of the land would be recited by the Lawspeaker, legal actions were brought against others, and any other announcements were made that were of import to the nation.

The day we visited was rainy and misty.
