Our visit to Yellowstone the first open week of the 2019 spring season.

This was my first time visiting Yellowstone National Park, a destination full of bison and geothermal oddities.

<h3>Yellowstone National Park</h3>
<p>Day 2, Heading to Norris Geyser Basin</p>

----

From our hotel in Idaho, we head back to the west entrance of the park for our second day's drive. Our quick drive to the park takes us from Idaho, through a corner of Montana, and into Wyoming as we enter the park.

We learned that the bison we saw hanging out near the west entrance the first day were there every day. They became a familiar sight to us at the beginning and end of our drives each day.

Our plan for the second day was to drive east into the park, stopping at interesting spots along the way, and ultimately reaching the Grand Canyon Falls area before turning around.

<h3>Waterfall</h3>

----

I don't know the name of the first waterfall we came to, but it was a dramatic gorge along the side of the road.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="River and mountains" data-echo="https://open-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/kagreenme/yellowstone2019-day02-smallwaterfall.png" class="img-fluid">

We had a sheer drop down to the river on one side of the road, and a crumbling rock face above us on the other side. While we were there, many small stones tumbled off that cliff face into the road.

<h3>Beryl Spring</h3>

----

Beryl Spring (which I learned is pronounced "burl") is a small and steamy hot spring. Easy to stop at, as it is just off the road. It's hard to miss the thick, white cloud of steam when driving past.

The spring itself is a vivid blue pool of boiling water. You can hear the powerful noise of the steam coming out of the vent to the side of the pool.

It was hard to get a good photo of the spring among all the steam, so the video captures the experience a bit better than any of the photos I took there.

<h3>Grand Prismatic Spring</h3>

----

Our next stop was the Midway Geyser Basin, where the Grand Prismatic Spring is located.

Due to the rainy weather, my pictures of this spot are not nearly as dramatic as the magazine pictures of the same place, although it was beautiful nonetheless. The iconic image of this pool shows it with a rainbow of color.

This was our first look at the strange shapes and colors made by the bacteria that live in the waters of the Yellowstone geothermal features.

A river runs past the entrance to the spring, and hot water pours down from the spring, steaming into the river, and creating brightly covered rivulets.

<h3>Biscuit Basin</h3>

----

This area is named for geological features that are no longer in the area. There used to be "biscuit-like deposits" surrounding Sapphire Pool (one of several pools at the site), but in 1959 the deposits were blown away when Sapphire erupted. So no more biscuits!

Here you can see a close up shot of some of the strange yellow bacteria that provides color to these hot pools.

This shallow stream runs on top of this bright green growth.

On a cold day, the steam blowing off the hot pools provides a moment of comforting warmth, but leaves you soaked and freezing when the wind changes the next moment to blow the warm steam away.

<h3>Black Sand Basin</h3>

----

Black Sand Basin is a short distance away from Old Faithful. It is part of the Upper Geyser Basin and is home to several colorful hot pools and geysers.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Black Sand Basin" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/yellowstone2019-blacksandbasin-03.png" class="img-fluid">

The hot pools create a steamy fog.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Black Sand Basin" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/yellowstone2019-blacksandbasin-02.png" class="img-fluid">

This water bubbled and splashed ominously.
