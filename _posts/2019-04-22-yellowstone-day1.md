Our visit to Yellowstone the first open week of the 2019 spring season.

This was my first time visiting Yellowstone National Park, a destination full of bison and geothermal oddities.

<h3>Yellowstone National Park</h3>
<p>Day 1, Heading to Old Faithful</p>

----

We entered Yellowstone from the west entrance, and very soon came across a small group of bison walking along the road.

Our trip was in the very beginning of spring, so there were tons of bison grazing alongside the road, where the snow had melted. Up on the mountains, patches of snow still clung. I'm not sure if it is common for the bison to use the paved roads later in the season, but we saw plenty of them out on the roads. We seemed to see the same herd on the road near the west entrance for the whole week of our trip.

Our plan for day one was to head down to watch Old Faithful, with stops at whatever was interesting along the way. The road south was closed beyond Old Faithful, so that is the furthest we could go into the park that direction.

<h3>Fountain Paint Pots</h3>

----

The first sight we came to (that was open) was the Fountain Paint Pots area, a collection of mud geysers.

A fun one was the "Red Spouter"

<h3>Grand Prismatic Spring</h3>

----

Our next stop was the Midway Geyser Basin, where the Grand Prismatic Spring is located.

Due to the rainy weather, my pictures of this spot are not nearly as dramatic as the magazine pictures of the same place, although it was beautiful nonetheless. The iconic image of this pool shows it with a rainbow of color.

This was our first look at the strange shapes and colors made by the bacteria that live in the waters of the Yellowstone geothermal features.

A river runs past the entrance to the spring, and hot water pours down from the spring, steaming into the river, and creating brightly covered rivulets.

<h3>Biscuit Basin</h3>

----

This area is named for geological features that are no longer in the area. There used to be "biscuit-like deposits" surrounding Sapphire Pool (one of several pools at the site), but in 1959 the deposits were blown away when Sapphire erupted. So no more biscuits!

Here you can see a close up shot of some of the strange yellow bacteria that provides color to these hot pools.

This shallow stream runs on top of this bright green growth.

On a cold day, the steam blowing off the hot pools provides a moment of comforting warmth, but leaves you soaked and freezing when the wind changes the next moment to blow the warm steam away.

<h3>Black Sand Basin</h3>

----

Black Sand Basin is a short distance away from Old Faithful. It is part of the Upper Geyser Basin and is home to several colorful hot pools and geysers.

The hot pools create a steamy fog.

This water bubbled and splashed ominously.
