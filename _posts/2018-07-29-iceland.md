My second trip to Iceland was a new kind of holiday for me--a multi-day horse riding tour in the Vatnsdalur Valley in North Iceland.

The tour included four days of riding around Lake Hop, as well as a few additional excursions in the evenings.

First, I want to thank Cori from billandcori.com for posting details about their own experiences on this same tour, my friend and I scoured their posts for details of what to expect on the tour. It was a tour so nice, they went on it twice! Their first experience is <a href="https://www.billandcori.com/iceland/trail_of_hope.htm">here</a> and their second trip is <a href="https://www.billandcori.com/iceland/trail_of_hope_again.htm">detailed here</a>.

I had only been riding for about a year at the time of this trip. The tour description calls for "Intermediate" level riders, which I was not yet! But this tour mostly calls for walk, trot, tolt, canter and basic physical fitness.

<h3>Arrival in Vatnsdalur</h3>
<p>Day 1 - Sunday July 29, 2018</p>

----

As part of the cost of the tour, we were picked up from close to our hotel in Reykjavik and driven the 3 or so hours on a very comfortable bus. The bus stopped 3 times for us to use the restroom and pick up snacks at gas stations along the way. I suppose they are used to have a tour full of ladies, as ours was!

The Trail of Hope tour begins at Hvammur Farm at lunchtime on Sunday. When we arrived, we were greeted by our lovely tour guides and a delicious lunch. The owner of the farm and primary guide is Haukur, who is an amazing tour leader. Hjordis was chief horse whisperer, horse-human matchmaker, and organizer of the facebook group. Two of our guides actually live in the Netherlands most of the year, but use their vacation weeks to ride on this tour every year. One guide was a student from Germany, living at the farm for the summer.

The way the tour works is that the guests and horses all begin at Hvammur Farm. Over the course of 4 days, we ride around (and through) Lake Hop. The horses spend each night in a new location, but the humans take a van back to the guesthouse each evening, and then are delivered back to the horses in the morning.

Above is a picture of the guesthouse. The guesthouse has four people per room, but in our room, two people slept on a lower level, and two of us slept in a lofted space, so it was actually quite private. We were not in our rooms most of the time, as the guesthouse has very comfy common areas for hanging out.

Here is the barn at Hvammur farm, where we first greeted our horses.

For the first day, I left all of the cameras behind, since I didn't know what to expect on our first ride. We all trooped out to the barn, and gathered up some gear. The saddles are all the same, but we labeled them with our names so that we didn't have to adjust stirrups each day. They also offered helmets, rain gear, and saddle bags.

We then met our horses. My first mount of the trip was a lovely mare Grima. We started our ride with just Haukur and the twenty-or-so guests. After giving us some time to get used to the horses, the other guides caught up to us with the herd. There were about 80 horses in the herd, owned by Haukur, Hjordis, and several neighbors who contribute their horses to the tours for the summer.

Riding with the herd of loose horses is one of the best parts of this tour. The guests are split between riding at the front and back of the herd. The guides do the heavy lifting of keeping the horses organized and together in a group. As a beginner rider, I stayed with the riders at the back of the herd most of the trip. This is where all the slow poke horses hang out, so we got more walk breaks than the front-of-the-herd riders.

The horses were left at Sveinsstadir Farm for the night, and we returned to Hvammur to sleep.

<h3>We Reach Lake Hop</h3>
<p>Day 2 - Monday July 30, 2018</p>

On day 2, we rode from Sveinsstadir to Lake Hop. Along the way we passed other horses, curious about our herd. One escaped from its pasture to join us, and the guides had to herd it back home. The first part of the day involved slogging through mud, but after arriving at the lake shore, the trail was much more open and solid.

We crossed a river before arriving at the lake shore. Water crossings are no big deal to these horses.

In the afternoon, after we finished riding for the day, we took an excursion to Hvitserkur, a basalt rock formation on the ocean shore.

Walking along the shore, we could see a pod of seals lounging on a sand bar.

The landscape close to the beach was a beautiful contrast of black sand and green grasses.

<h3>Borgavirki</h3>
<p>Day 2 Excursion</p>

----

Our next excursion was to Borgavirki, a volcanic plug built into a old fortress. The true history of the site is unknown, but it is believed to be a fortification from around 870 - 1030 AD.

At last, we returned on our faithful van back to the guesthouse for some dinner and much-needed sleep.

<h3>Sigríðarstaðasandur Blank Sand Dunes</h3>
<p>Morning, Day 3 - Tuesday July 31, 2018</p>

----

Good morning horses! We are all sleepy in the morning, but this was the most memorable day of the trip.

On the third day, we retrieve the horses from an interesting structure of pens that I believe is used primarily used for sheep. There are pens arranged around a central circular corral. Each pen has a family name over it.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="horses at fence" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/iceland2018-day3-03.png" class="img-fluid">

On this day, we packed our lunches and carried them in our saddlebags, rather than the van bringing the food to us.

The guides' lunches are in Mikki's saddlebags here.

We left the herd behind with the guides while we rode through dunes of Sigríðarstaðasandur. I believe the herd took a different route, as they would do too much damage to the dunes, but riding through the dunes was beautiful.

After the soft dunes, we climbed a steep, rocky ridge, and then came down to the water's edge.

The herd joined us as we ate our lunch and enjoyed the great view.

<h3>Through the Lake</h3>
<p>Afternoon, Day 3 - Tuesday July 31, 2018</p>

----

I have no pictures of the best part of the trip! After our lunch break, we prepared to ride across the lake. The guides tried to match us with our favorite horses this day, so I rode Grima again, who I had ridden the first afternoon.

The tour description mentions riding across a lake, and then letting the horses run when we reach the beach on the far side. That is what I thought we were getting into. Instead, we began to ford the water, quite deep in the beginning. But then we rose up again, as if we rode along a trail just under a few inches of water.

At this point, Haukur began to canter. He had warned us to expect some speed, but that we could continue as slowly as we liked. In my case, I tried to stay a little slower at first, but after I felt comfortable, we went at the speed Grima wanted to go so that I didn't feel I was holding her back.

We cantered for what felt like a long time (as a beginner rider, I usually only canter around the arena once or twice a lesson, so anything more than a minute feels long!). When we slowed down and everyone grouped back together at the far side, we were all grinning and covered in splattered mud.

<h3>Across Lake Húnavatn</h3>
<p>Day 4 - Wednesday August 1, 2018</p>

----

Sadly, we arrived at our last day!

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="horses at fence" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/iceland2018-day4-01.png" class="img-fluid">

I also  do not have so many photos of this day (due to fear of dropping the camera in the lake!)

It turns out that this is the day where we were meant to cross a lake and then let the horses run on the far side. This lake crossing was very deep--deep enough for the horses to swim. The waterproof boots were very important! It was a very cool experience.

Unfortunately, on the far side we did not let the horses canter. We had some trouble getting the herd across in a orderly fashion, and a few decided to take off for the hills. Haukur had to ride off to collect them while the other guides worked to get the herd across the water. So it goes with keeping eighty loose horses in line!

In the afternoon we wound our way through some areas with beautiful streams. On the next trip, maybe I'll actually get some photos of this part, haha!

Above, you can see Hvammur Farm coming into view in the distance.

We said goodbye to the horses, and cleaned off our very muddy saddles and saddlebags.

It was a beautiful afternoon. Below you see the clouds that get stuck in the mountain ridge behind the farm.

And we made our way back to the guesthouse to pack. Auf wiedersehen, friends!
