I visited Sedona, AZ with my family because it was a central location for us to meet up, and it was close to the big attraction, the Grand Canyon.

I ended up loving the beautiful Sedona area, and I would love the chance to go back and spend more time hiking and touring art fairs there.

Sedona is a doorway the Arizona outdoors. We went in mid-September, which was perfect weather for hiking in the morning, and then chilling out in the afternoon. The heat wasn't unbearable for all-day outdoor activities for some of us, but it was for others. Pack some water bottles!

At night, my father and I would find a place to park away from the lights of the town, to look up at the stars. There are so many stars that I never knew were there.

<h3>Rock Formations and Vortex Locations</h3>
<p>Introduction to Sedona</p>

----

I knew almost nothing about Sedona, AZ when we arrived. My life was in a state of great change at the time of this holiday. The Friday before flying to Phoenix was my last day at work, and after the end of this trip I would be heading to France for three months. I had left the planning of activities to my sister and did no research on the area.

One of the first things we learned from a local is that the area is home to four famous vortex sites. What is a vortex? Well we asked the local, and what I understood from his explanation is that it is a point where energy collects.

After some more reading, the term vortex is applied the same way it would to a whirlpool or a tornado, except instead of water or air, the vortex in this context is a point where energy spins around a central axis.

The local said that you could find a vortex anywhere, and that he encountered one reaching into a refrigerator at the grocery store to grab a bottle of milk.

So, of course, we added to our to-do list to check out the four well-known vortex spots in the area. We made it to three of the four locations. (I'll plan to visit the fourth next time I travel to Sedona.)

<h3>Airport Mesa</h3>

The easiest vortex to visit is Airport Mesa. This is a beautiful spot from which you can get an amazing view of the city.

There is also a short, fairly easy loop trail if you are looking for a beginners hike. As far as I could tell the vortex encompasses a wide area around the spot. I admit, I did not sense any special energy at this vortex spot, but there is a special feeling to being out among the red rocks in all of the hiking trails around the area.

We first visited at sunset, which I highly recommend. There were plenty of other people with the same idea, but it was a friendly crowd.

<h3>Cathedral Rock</h3>

As you can see in the photo below, our visit to Cathedral Rock was quite distant from the rock formation itself. More serious hikers can get closer, and climb onto the formation itself, but that was not in the plans for this trip.

Cathedral Rock is said to have "soft and nurturing energy flow. It is a good spot for reflection and meditation.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Cathedral rock" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/sedona-cathedral-rock-distant.png" class="img-fluid">

To visit Cathedral Rock, we went to Crescent Moon Ranch, which is a park along Oak Creek. There is a cost of admission, but it is a lovely park to spend the afternoon with a picnic. There is plenty of shade, and small trails to walk along in the woods.

Along the trail, if you head closer to Cathedral Rock, there is an expanse of smooth red stone on the ground. It is a nice place to relax on the warm stones and get in touch with the energy of the location.

<h3>Bell Rock</h3>

Bell Rock is easy to park relatively close to. We climbed up a few levels of its layers, but there were definitely a few places where we had to scramble to get up and down.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Bell Rock" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/sedona-bell-rock.png" class="img-fluid">

We climbed Bell Rock in the evening and enjoyed a relatively secluded experience.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Bell Rock" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/sedona-bell-rock-close.png" class="img-fluid">

It is also a good location from which to get a view of several other striking rock formations in the area.

<h3>The Chapel of the Holy Cross</h3>
<p>AKA the Chapel in the Rock</p>

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Chapel of the Holy Cross" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/sedona-chapel.png" class="img-fluid">

The chapel is built into the classic red rock of Sedona. The chapel has a very modern appearance, with clean, flowing curves and yet it seems right at home among the natural rock formations.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Chapel of the Holy Cross" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/sedona-chapel-walk.png" class="img-fluid">

One of my favorite parts is the curving walkway that lifts you up to the entrance of the chapel.

The curving lines continue in the flowing design of the platform at the chapel entrance.

Look closely. In the image below, you can see the Chapel from afar, in a picture I took a couple days later from Bell Rock as the sun set.

<h3>Fay Canyon</h3>

----

I found the Fay Canyon hike through searching for low-incline hikes in the area to accommodate other family members who had had their fill of scrambling over rocks for the week.

This hike is generally quite flat and has good footing, although there are a few places where the trail crosses a stream or has larger loose rocks in it which can be harder to traverse if you are not sure-footed. The trail is about a mile long.

Those of you who have read my other posts will appreciate that we are back to stormy skies here. You were probably confused about all the blue skies on this holiday! Luckily, we did not get caught in a rainstorm while we were hiking.

At the end of the trail, you reach the rock face of the canyon. If you are so inclined (as of course, some of us were), you can scramble up the rocks. We heard there is an archway if you keep scrambling up and back, but we did not encounter it before we decided the route was a bit beyond our comfort level.

<h3>Native American Ruins</h3>
<p>Adventures Outside of Sedona</p>

----

We spent some time exploring more of the Verde Valley region, outside of Sedona.

<h3>Montezuma Well</h3>

The first ruins we visited were the Montezuma Well, which is a small circular lake with cliff dwellings cut into the surrounding rocks.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Montezuma Well" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/sedona-montezuma-well.png" class="img-fluid">

Over 1.5 million gallons of warm water (76 degrees Fahrenheit) flow into the well daily. The source of the water is unknown. The water flows out via a "swallet" (an underground stream), and then into an irrigation ditch which is still used today by residents of Rimrock, AZ.

The water is a unique ecosystem, and home to at least five species not found anywhere else (like it's own breed of leech).

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Montezuma Well Swallet" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/sedona-montezuma-well-swallet.png" class="img-fluid">

Early white settlers believed this to be an Aztec ruin, hence the Montezuma name, but this site was not an Aztec settlement. Among other peoples over the centuries, the Sinagua people from around 900 AD to 1400 AD. It is not known what caused them to leave the area.

<h3>Montezuma Castle</h3>

We next visited the similarly misnamed Montezuma Castle, more Sinagua cliff ruins about 11 miles away from the well. The park at Montezuma Well is actually considered part of the Montezuma Castle National Monument, although the two sites are not physically connected.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Montezuma Castle" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/sedona-montezuma-castle-2.png" class="img-fluid">

Beaver Creek, running through the Montezuma Castle park, is one of the perennial streams that flows to the Verde River. This water provided the ability to live an agricultural lifestyle in a part of the country that is otherwise arid.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Montezuma Castle" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/sedona-montezuma-castle-river.png" class="img-fluid">

<h3>Tuzigoot</h3>

Tuzigoot National Monument has preserved Sinagua pueblo ruins. Unlike at Montezuma Castle, it is possible to get closer to the dwellings in this park.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Montezuma Castle" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/sedona-tuzigoot.png" class="img-fluid">

The area is undergoing re-vegetation now, as a copper mine in the area used the land around these ruins as a tailings pond (place to dump mine waste).

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Montezuma Castle" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/sedona-tuzigoot-2.png" class="img-fluid">

Archeologists believe that the dwellings were accessed via rooftop hatches with ladders, as there are very few doorways in the buildings.
