<h3>Vik to Vatnajökull Glacier</h3>
<p>Morning, Day 2</p>

----

We headed out of Vik the next morning towards Vatnajökull Glacier and eventually Jokulsarlon Lagoon.

The road jogs inland here, so the ocean was no longer visible on our right. The air was hazy, and it was difficult to see much out ahead of us. The air thickened, and we realized we were in the middle of a basalt sand storm.

The flat landscape results in perfect conditions for basalt sand to be carried about by the wind. Even after we passed through the sandstorm, the mountains ahead of us continued to appear hazy due to the sand in the air.

<h3>Vatnajökull Glacier and Skaftafell Park</h3>
<p>Afternoon, Day 2</p>

----

After a few hours of driving, we arrived at our next destination, Skaftafell Nature Preserve, located in Vatnajökull National Park.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Vatnajokull Glacier" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/iceland2017-vatnajokull.png" class="img-fluid">

Vatnajökull is an enormous glacier, covering more than 8% of Iceland.

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Vatnajokull Glacier from Satellite" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/iceland2017-satellite.png" class="img-fluid">

In the satellite image above, Vatnajökull is the large white area in the southeast corner of the country.

Volcanoes lurk below the ice. Sub-glacial eruptions and geothermal heat under the ice cap can create sealed lakes within the glacier. When that seal breaks, the result is a sudden massive flood called a jökulhlaup.

In the image below, I've zoomed in and noted Skaftafell Park (where the photos in this segment are from), and Jokulsarlon Lagoon (pictures from this are in the next section).

<img src="/img/blank.png" alt="Vatnajokull Glacier from Satellite" data-echo="https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-photos/kagreenme/iceland2017-satellite-zoom.png" class="img-fluid">

As a side note here, you'll notice that in this phase of our trip, we've been driving all morning through beautiful landscapes. However, there were no open restaurants along this route, and the restaurant at Skaftafell was not open for the season. We got some snacks at the visitors center, but nothing like real lunch.

I'm not normally the type of traveler to pack my own food, but if I were to do this trip over again, I would have brought more granola bars, dried fruit and chocolate with me from the U.S. And possibly tried to make a sandwich to go from the hotel's breakfast offerings each morning. We didn't seem to pass any grocery stores along our route (although they must exist?) and our hotel rooms didn't have refrigerators, so buying sandwich fixings once in the country wasn't an option that would play out well without additional planning.

So, eating our snacks, we forged onward into the park on foot.

The image below is Svartifoss ("Black Falls") waterfall from a distance. The rock formations around Svartifoss are hexagonal columnar jointed basalt (remember the rocks at Kirkjufjara beach earlier?) which are formed by when lava cools, due to how it loses heat.

These basalt columns around the waterfall crumble off piece by piece, so visitors are encouraged to stay on the footpaths. In addition, it is important to stay on the footpaths as the vegetation in the area is very delicate.

We hiked on past the waterfall. We mis-read a sign along the trail at some point, as we had intended to hike to a view of the Skaftafellsjökull. Instead, we ended up on the wrong side of the park. As a consolation prize, we had a view of this beautiful peak (Skerholl, I believe).

<h3>Jokulsarlon Lagoon</h3>
<p>Evening, Day 2</p>

----

Back to the car! We drove a short distance further to Jokulsarlon Lagoon, a lake at the edge of the glacier. Chunks of ice break off of the glacier and the lagoon is full of floating icebergs.

It is a favorite spot with photographers, for good reason, but it is also one of the most peaceful places I have ever visited.

We arrived at the lagoon around four in the afternoon, strolling around as the sun sank low.

The lagoon connects to the ocean, and there are seals that live in the lake.

<h3>Hotel</h3>
<p>Night, Day 2</p>

----

There are not many hotels to choose from in this part of Iceland. We spent the night at Fosshotel Glacier Lagoon (in Fagurholsmyri), which was very beautiful and had wonderful food.
